## Running the Project

This project consists of two parts: `app` (frontend) and `server` (backend). You need to run them in separate terminals.

### Frontend (`app`)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `app` directory:  
   ```sh
   cd app
   ```  
2. Install dependencies (only required the first time):  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```  
3. Start the frontend server:  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend (`server`)

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the `server` directory:  
   ```sh
   cd server
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```  
3. Start the backend server:  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Troubleshooting Backend Issues

If you encounter an error about missing packages, the terminal will indicate which package is missing. You can install it manually using:  
```sh
npm install package-name
```  

If you're unsure about the error message, you can copy and paste it into ChatGPT for clarification.
